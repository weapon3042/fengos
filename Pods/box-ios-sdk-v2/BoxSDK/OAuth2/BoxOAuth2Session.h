/**
 * BoxOAuth2Session is an abstract class you can use to encapsulate managing a set of OAuth2
 * credentials, an access token and a refresh token. Because this class is abstract, you should
 * not instantiate it directly. You can either use the provided BoxSerialOAuth2Session or implement your
 * own subclass (see subclassing notes). This class does enforce its abstractness via calls to the
 * `BOXAbstract` macro, which will raise an `NSAssert` when `DEBUG=1`.
 *
 * This class provides support for the [Authorization Code Grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)
 * and [refreshing an access token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6). See
 * [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for more information about the OAuth2 spec.
 *
 * The Authorization Code Grant requires a web view to allow the user to authenticate with Box and Authorize your
 * application. Upon successful authorization, the webview will launch a custom URL scheme. Your app must capture
 * this open in request in your App delegate and forward the URL to performAuthorizationCodeGrantWithReceivedURL:.
 *
 * NSNotifications
 * ===============
 * An OAuth2 session will issue the following notifications when the authorization state changes:
 *
 * - `BoxOAuth2SessionDidBecomeAuthenticatedNotification` upon successfully exchanging an authorization code for a
 *   set of tokens.
 * - `BoxOAuth2SessionDidReceiveAuthenricationErrorNotification` when the authorization code grant fails.
 * - `BoxOAuth2SessionDidRefreshTokensNotification` upon successfully refreshing an access token.
 * - `BoxOAuth2SessionDidReceiveRefreshErrorNotification` when a refresh attempt has failed (for example because
 *   the refresh token has been revoked or is expired).
 *
 * Subclassing Notes
 * =================
 * Subclasses must implement all abstract methods in this class. These include:
 *
 * - performAuthorizationCodeGrantWithReceivedURL:
 * - grantTokensURL
 * - authorizeURL
 * - redirectURIString
 * - performRefreshTokenGrant
 * - isAuthorized
 *
 * Service Settings on Box
 * =======================
 * **Note**: When setting up your service on Box, leave the OAuth2 reditrect URI blank.
 * The SDK will provide a custom redirect URI when issuing OAuth2 calls; doing so requires
 * that no redirect URI be set in your service settings.
